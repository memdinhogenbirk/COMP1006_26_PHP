/*So this was a fun time. 

You will note the port 3307 addition I made. Due to port conflicts (presumably with workbench running on the same port).
I had to manually change the my.ini file instances of 3306 to 3307 to get this working, as well as change windows file permissions for the xampp-control.ini 
so it would be editable when using config in the xampp terminal.

I also had to manually add in $cfg['Servers'][$i]['port'] = '3307'; to the config.inc.php file in phpmyadmin folder to fully get this working.

Without these changes, I could not even access my local server through phpmyadmin, let alone get this assignment working.
And by golly, it's working.
